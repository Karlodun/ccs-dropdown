Motivation: with html5 we entered the age of semantic web, following this my philosophy is to perfectionalize the semantics, simplicity and shortness, while keeping the structure and code readable and parseable on any device, even without css.
Right now nearly 100% of tutarials and examples for drop-down menues use unordered, or even ordered lists. However the most link collections are no lists at all. Also many soures use unnecessarily many elements and wrappers.
After some time I developed this dropdown navigation menu, which seems to least confusing in terms of semantics and uses as little code as possible (customization and such excluded).
